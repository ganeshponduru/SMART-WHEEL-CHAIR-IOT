# SMART-WHEEL-CHAIR-IOT
This project focuses on designing a smart wheelchair that can be controlled using voice commands and a joystick, enabling improved mobility for elderly and differently-abled individuals. The system is built using ESP32, motor drivers, and voice recognition modules, providing both manual and hands-free control.
