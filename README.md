# SMART-WHEEL-CHAIR-IOT:
This project focuses on designing a smart wheelchair that can be controlled using voice commands and a joystick, enabling improved mobility for elderly and differently-abled individuals. The system is built using Arduino, ESP32, motor drivers, and voice recognition modules, providing both manual and hands-free control.It also detects when a fall happens.

Features:

 Voice command control using speech recognition
 Joystick manual navigation
 IoT monitoring for remote supervision ( detection of falls )
 Real-time motor control using Arduino Uno
 Low-power efficient hardware design
